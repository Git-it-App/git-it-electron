    <p i18n-data="ch10~You'll now see a page with the details of the pull request you're in the process of submitting. This page shows the commits and changes, in the form of a diff, associated with your pull request as compared to the 'gh-pages' branch of the original."></p>

    <p i18n-data="ch10~If all is well with your pull request, it will be merged within moments. If it's not merged automatically within a few minutes, you'll then likely have some comments from @reporobot on why it couldn't merge it. If this is the case, close your pull request on GitHub, make the necessary changes to your branch, push those changes back to your fork and reopen (this will poke @reporobot to look over it again) your pull request."></p>
